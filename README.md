# Classification-of-News-Articles-Real-vs.-Fake-
A machine learning project to detect fake news using various models.

This project aims to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using machine learning models.  
Dataset: [Fake News Detection Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/fake-news-detection)

## ðŸ”¹ Project Steps
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) , Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)
- Feature engineering  
- Model training (Logistic Regression, SVM, ANN, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Kappa, and other metrics  


## ðŸ”¹ Results
- Best performing model: Finally, The Random Forest model is the most effective classifier for identifying fake news and plagiarism_score is the most important feature in the Random Forest model.
